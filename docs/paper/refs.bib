    abstract = {Percolation models describe the inside of a porous material. The theory emerged timidly in the middle of the twentieth century before becoming one of the major objects of interest in probability and mathematical physics. The golden age of percolation is probably the eighties, during which most of the major results were obtained for the most classical of these models, named Bernoulli percolation, but it is really the two following decades which put percolation theory at the crossroad of several domains of mathematics. In this short (and very partial) review, we propose to describe briefly some of the recent progress as well as some famous challenges remaining in the field. This review is not intended to probabilists (and a fortiori not to specialists in percolation theory): the target audience is mathematicians of all kinds.},

    abstract = {The problem of cluster size distribution and percolation on a regular lattice or graph of bonds and sites is reviewed and its applications to dilute ferromagnetism, polymer gelation, etc., briefly discussed. The cluster size and percolation problems are then solved exactly for Bethe lattices (infinite homogeneous Cayley trees) and for a wide class of pseudolattices derived by replacing the bonds and/or sites of a Bethe lattice by arbitrary finite subgraphs. Explicit expressions are given for the critical probability (density), for the mean cluster size, and for the density of infinite clusters. The nature of the critical anomalies is shown to be the same for all lattices discussed; in particular, the density of infinite clusters vanishes as R(p) {$\approx$} C(p-pc) (p{$\geq$}pc).},

This paper describes how heuristic information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of search strategies.},
