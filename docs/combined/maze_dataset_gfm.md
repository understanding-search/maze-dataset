# `maze-dataset`

This package provides utilities for generation, filtering, solving,
visualizing, and processing of mazes for training ML systems. Primarily
built for the [maze-transformer
interpretability](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-transformer)
project. You can find our paper on it here:
http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10498

This package includes a variety of [maze generation
algorithms](maze_dataset/generation/generators.py), including randomized
depth first search, Wilson’s algorithm for uniform spanning trees, and
percolation. Datasets can be filtered to select mazes of a certain
length or complexity, remove duplicates, and satisfy custom properties.
A variety of output formats for visualization and training ML models are
provided.

# Usage

## Creating a dataset

To create a `MazeDataset`, which inherits from
`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, you first create a `MazeDatasetConfig`:

``` python
from maze_dataset import MazeDataset, MazeDatasetConfig
from maze_dataset.generation import LatticeMazeGenerators
cfg: MazeDatasetConfig = MazeDatasetConfig(
    name="test", # name is only for you to keep track of things
    grid_n=5, # number of rows/columns in the lattice
    n_mazes=4, # number of mazes to generate
    maze_ctor=LatticeMazeGenerators.gen_dfs, # algorithm to generate the maze
    maze_ctor_kwargs=dict(do_forks=False), # additional parameters to pass to the maze generation algorithm
)
```

and then pass this config to the `MazeDataset.from_config` method:

``` python
dataset: MazeDataset = MazeDataset.from_config(cfg)
```

This method can search for whether a dataset with matching config hash
already exists on your filesystem in the expected location, and load it
if so. It can also generate a dataset on the fly if needed.

## Conversions to useful formats

The elements of the dataset are
[`SolvedMaze`](maze_dataset/maze/lattice_maze.py) objects:

``` python
>>> m = dataset[0]
>>> type(m)
maze_dataset.maze.lattice_maze.SolvedMaze
```

Which can be converted to a variety of formats:

``` python
# visual representation as ascii art
m.as_ascii() 
# RGB image, optionally without solution or endpoints, suitable for CNNs
m.as_pixels() 
# text format for autoreregressive transformers
from maze_dataset.tokenization import MazeTokenizerModular, TokenizationMode
m.as_tokens(maze_tokenizer=MazeTokenizerModular(
    tokenization_mode=TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_rasterized, max_grid_size=100,
))
# advanced visualization with many features
from maze_dataset.plotting import MazePlot
MazePlot(maze).plot()
```

### `maze-dataset`

This package provides utilities for generation, filtering, solving,
visualizing, and processing of mazes for training ML systems. Primarily
built for the [maze-transformer
interpretability](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-transformer)
project. You can find our paper on it here:
http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10498

This package includes a variety of [maze generation
algorithms](maze_dataset/generation/generators.py), including randomized
depth first search, Wilson’s algorithm for uniform spanning trees, and
percolation. Datasets can be filtered to select mazes of a certain
length or complexity, remove duplicates, and satisfy custom properties.
A variety of output formats for visualization and training ML models are
provided.

### Usage

#### Creating a dataset

To create a `MazeDataset`, which inherits from
`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, you first create a `MazeDatasetConfig`:

``` python
from maze_dataset import MazeDataset, MazeDatasetConfig
from <a href="maze_dataset/generation.html">maze_dataset.generation</a> import LatticeMazeGenerators
cfg: MazeDatasetConfig = MazeDatasetConfig(
    name="test", # name is only for you to keep track of things
    grid_n=5, # number of rows/columns in the lattice
    n_mazes=4, # number of mazes to generate
    maze_ctor=LatticeMazeGenerators.gen_dfs, # algorithm to generate the maze
    maze_ctor_kwargs=dict(do_forks=False), # additional parameters to pass to the maze generation algorithm
)
```

and then pass this config to the
`<a href="#MazeDataset.from_config">MazeDataset.from_config</a>` method:

``` python
dataset: MazeDataset = <a href="#MazeDataset.from_config">MazeDataset.from_config</a>(cfg)
```

This method can search for whether a dataset with matching config hash
already exists on your filesystem in the expected location, and load it
if so. It can also generate a dataset on the fly if needed.

#### Conversions to useful formats

The elements of the dataset are
[`SolvedMaze`](maze_dataset/maze/lattice_maze.py) objects:

``` python
>>> m = dataset[0]
>>> type(m)
<a href="#SolvedMaze">SolvedMaze</a>
```

Which can be converted to a variety of formats:

``` python
### visual representation as ascii art
m.as_ascii() 
### RGB image, optionally without solution or endpoints, suitable for CNNs
m.as_pixels() 
### text format for autoreregressive transformers
from <a href="maze_dataset/tokenization.html">maze_dataset.tokenization</a> import MazeTokenizerModular, TokenizationMode
m.as_tokens(maze_tokenizer=MazeTokenizerModular(
    tokenization_mode=TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_rasterized, max_grid_size=100,
))
### advanced visualization with many features
from <a href="maze_dataset/plotting.html">maze_dataset.plotting</a> import MazePlot
MazePlot(maze).plot()
```

generate a lattice maze using depth first search, iterative

### Arguments

- `grid_shape: Coord`: the shape of the grid
- `lattice_dim: int`: the dimension of the lattice (default: `2`)
- `accessible_cells: int | float |None`: the number of accessible cells
  in the maze. If `None`, defaults to the total number of cells in the
  grid. if a float, asserts it is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of
  **total cells** (default: `None`)
- `max_tree_depth: int | float | None`: the maximum depth of the tree.
  If `None`, defaults to `2 * accessible_cells`. if a float, asserts it
  is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of the **sum of the grid
  shape** (default: `None`)
- `do_forks: bool`: whether to allow forks in the maze. If `False`, the
  maze will be have no forks and will be a simple hallway.
- `start_coord: Coord | None`: the starting coordinate of the generation
  algorithm. If `None`, defaults to a random coordinate.

### algorithm

1.  Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
2.  While the stack is not empty 1. Pop a cell from the stack and make
    it a current cell 2. If the current cell has any neighbours which
    have not been visited 1. Push the current cell to the stack 2.
    Choose one of the unvisited neighbours 3. Remove the wall between
    the current cell and the chosen cell 4. Mark the chosen cell as
    visited and push it to the stack

lattice maze (nodes on a lattice, connections only to neighboring nodes)

Connection List represents which nodes (N) are connected in each
direction.

First and second elements represent rightward and downward connections,
respectively.

Example: Connection list: \[ \[ \# down \[F T\], \[F F\] \], \[ \# right
\[T F\], \[T F\] \] \]

Nodes with connections N T N F F T N T N F F F

Graph: N - N \| N - N

Note: the bottom row connections going down, and the right-hand
connections going right, will always be False.

generate a lattice maze using depth first search, iterative

### Arguments

- `grid_shape: Coord`: the shape of the grid
- `lattice_dim: int`: the dimension of the lattice (default: `2`)
- `accessible_cells: int | float |None`: the number of accessible cells
  in the maze. If `None`, defaults to the total number of cells in the
  grid. if a float, asserts it is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of
  **total cells** (default: `None`)
- `max_tree_depth: int | float | None`: the maximum depth of the tree.
  If `None`, defaults to `2 * accessible_cells`. if a float, asserts it
  is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of the **sum of the grid
  shape** (default: `None`)
- `do_forks: bool`: whether to allow forks in the maze. If `False`, the
  maze will be have no forks and will be a simple hallway.
- `start_coord: Coord | None`: the starting coordinate of the generation
  algorithm. If `None`, defaults to a random coordinate.

### algorithm

1.  Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
2.  While the stack is not empty 1. Pop a cell from the stack and make
    it a current cell 2. If the current cell has any neighbours which
    have not been visited 1. Push the current cell to the stack 2.
    Choose one of the unvisited neighbours 3. Remove the wall between
    the current cell and the chosen cell 4. Mark the chosen cell as
    visited and push it to the stack

Wilson’s algorithm generates an unbiased (random) maze sampled from the
uniform distribution over all mazes, using loop-erased random walks. The
generated maze is acyclic and all cells are part of a unique connected
space.

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/dataset/__init__.py#L54-L199)

generate a lattice maze using depth first search, iterative

### Arguments

- `grid_shape: Coord`: the shape of the grid
- `lattice_dim: int`: the dimension of the lattice (default: `2`)
- `accessible_cells: int | float |None`: the number of accessible cells
  in the maze. If `None`, defaults to the total number of cells in the
  grid. if a float, asserts it is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of
  **total cells** (default: `None`)
- `max_tree_depth: int | float | None`: the maximum depth of the tree.
  If `None`, defaults to `2 * accessible_cells`. if a float, asserts it
  is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of the **sum of the grid
  shape** (default: `None`)
- `do_forks: bool`: whether to allow forks in the maze. If `False`, the
  maze will be have no forks and will be a simple hallway.
- `start_coord: Coord | None`: the starting coordinate of the generation
  algorithm. If `None`, defaults to a random coordinate.

### algorithm

1.  Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
2.  While the stack is not empty 1. Pop a cell from the stack and make
    it a current cell 2. If the current cell has any neighbours which
    have not been visited 1. Push the current cell to the stack 2.
    Choose one of the unvisited neighbours 3. Remove the wall between
    the current cell and the chosen cell 4. Mark the chosen cell as
    visited and push it to the stack

wrapper for torch dataset with some extra functionality

(meaning the functionality should be inherited in downstream classes)

> \[!NOTE\] `GPTDatasetConfig` should implement a `to_fname` method that
> returns a unique filename for the config

### Requires:

the following methods should be implemented in subclasses: -
`__init__(self, cfg: GPTDatasetConfig, **kwargs)` initialize the dataset
from a given config. kwargs are not passed through, the kwargs should
take the actual generated or loaded data (a list of objects or sequences
probably) -
`generate(cls, cfg: GPTDatasetConfig, **kwargs) -> GPTDataset` generate
the dataset from a given config. kwargs are passed through from
`from_config`, and should only contain things that dont belong in the
config (i.e. how many threads to use for generation) -
`serialize(self) -> JSONitem` serialize the dataset to a
ZANJ-serializable object, including: - config - data in formats
specified by `self.save_formats` -
`load(cls, data: JSONitem) -> GPTDataset` load the dataset from a
ZANJ-serializable object -
`download(cls, cfg: GPTDatasetConfig, **kwargs) -> GPTDataset` given a
config, try to download a dataset from some source. kwargs are passed
through from `from_config`, and should only contain things that dont
belong in the config (i.e. some kind of auth token or source url) -
`__len__(self) -> int` return the length of the dataset, required for
`torch.utils.data.Dataset` - `__getitem__(self, i: int) -> list[str]`
return the ith item in the dataset, required for
`torch.utils.data.Dataset` return the ith item in the dataset, required
for `torch.utils.data.Dataset` - `update_self_config(self) -> None`
update the config of the dataset to match the current state of the
dataset, used primarily in filtering and validation - decorating the
appropriate filter namespace with
`register_filter_namespace_for_dataset(your_dataset_class)` if you want
to use filters

### Parameters:

    - `cfg : GPTDatasetConfig`
    config for the dataset, used to generate the dataset
    - `do_generate : bool`
    whether to generate the dataset if it isn't found
    (defaults to `True`)
    - `load_local : bool`
    whether to try finding the dataset locally
    (defaults to `True`)
    - `save_local : bool`
    whether to save the dataset locally if it is generated or downloaded
    (defaults to `True`)
    - `do_download : bool`
    whether to try downloading the dataset
    (defaults to `True`)
    - `local_base_path : Path`
    where to save the dataset
    (defaults to `Path("data/maze_dataset")`)

### Returns:

    - `GPTDataset`
    the dataset, as you wanted it

### Implements:

    - `save(self, file_path: str) -> None`
    save the dataset to a file, using ZANJ
    - `read(cls, file_path: str) -> GPTDataset`
    read the dataset from a file, using ZANJ
    get all items in the dataset, in the specified format
    - `filter_by(self)`
    returns a namespace class
    -  `_filter_namespace(self) -> Class`
    returns a namespace class for filtering the dataset, checking that method
    - `_apply_filters_from_config(self) -> None`
    apply filters to the dataset, as specified in the config. used in `from_config()` but only when generating

### `def from_config`

``` python
(
    cls,
    cfg: maze_dataset.dataset.dataset.GPTDatasetConfig,
    do_generate: bool = True,

### `class DatasetFilterProtocol(typing.Protocol):`

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/dataset/dataset.py#L476-L481)

Base class for protocol classes.

Protocol classes are defined as::

    class Proto(Protocol):
        def meth(self) -> int:
            ...

Such classes are primarily used with static type checkers that recognize
structural subtyping (static duck-typing), for example::

    class C:
        def meth(self) -> int:
            return 0

    def func(x: Proto) -> int:
        return x.meth()

    func(C())  # Passes static type check

See PEP 544 for details. Protocol classes decorated with
@typing.runtime_checkable act as simple-minded runtime protocols that
check only the presence of given attributes, ignoring their type
signatures. Protocol classes can be generic, they are defined as::

    class GenProto(Protocol[T]):
        def meth(self) -> T:
            ...

generate a lattice maze using depth first search, iterative

### Arguments

- `grid_shape: Coord`: the shape of the grid
- `lattice_dim: int`: the dimension of the lattice (default: `2`)
- `accessible_cells: int | float |None`: the number of accessible cells
  in the maze. If `None`, defaults to the total number of cells in the
  grid. if a float, asserts it is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of
  **total cells** (default: `None`)
- `max_tree_depth: int | float | None`: the maximum depth of the tree.
  If `None`, defaults to `2 * accessible_cells`. if a float, asserts it
  is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of the **sum of the grid
  shape** (default: `None`)
- `do_forks: bool`: whether to allow forks in the maze. If `False`, the
  maze will be have no forks and will be a simple hallway.
- `start_coord: Coord | None`: the starting coordinate of the generation
  algorithm. If `None`, defaults to a random coordinate.

### algorithm

1.  Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
2.  While the stack is not empty 1. Pop a cell from the stack and make
    it a current cell 2. If the current cell has any neighbours which
    have not been visited 1. Push the current cell to the stack 2.
    Choose one of the unvisited neighbours 3. Remove the wall between
    the current cell and the chosen cell 4. Mark the chosen cell as
    visited and push it to the stack

### `def gen_dfs`

``` python
(
    grid_shape: jaxtyping.Int8[ndarray, 'row_col'],
    lattice_dim: int = 2,
    accessible_cells: int | float | None = None,

```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/generation/__init__.py#L54-L199)

generate a lattice maze using depth first search, iterative

### Arguments

- `grid_shape: Coord`: the shape of the grid
- `lattice_dim: int`: the dimension of the lattice (default: `2`)
- `accessible_cells: int | float |None`: the number of accessible cells
  in the maze. If `None`, defaults to the total number of cells in the
  grid. if a float, asserts it is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of
  **total cells** (default: `None`)
- `max_tree_depth: int | float | None`: the maximum depth of the tree.
  If `None`, defaults to `2 * accessible_cells`. if a float, asserts it
  is \<= 1 and treats it as a proportion of the **sum of the grid
  shape** (default: `None`)
- `do_forks: bool`: whether to allow forks in the maze. If `False`, the
  maze will be have no forks and will be a simple hallway.
- `start_coord: Coord | None`: the starting coordinate of the generation
  algorithm. If `None`, defaults to a random coordinate.

### algorithm

1.  Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
2.  While the stack is not empty 1. Pop a cell from the stack and make
    it a current cell 2. If the current cell has any neighbours which
    have not been visited 1. Push the current cell to the stack 2.
    Choose one of the unvisited neighbours 3. Remove the wall between
    the current cell and the chosen cell 4. Mark the chosen cell as
    visited and push it to the stack

Generate a lattice maze using Wilson’s algorithm.

### Algorithm

Wilson’s algorithm generates an unbiased (random) maze sampled from the
uniform distribution over all mazes, using loop-erased random walks. The
generated maze is acyclic and all cells are part of a unique connected
space.

generate a lattice maze using simple percolation

note that p in the range (0.4, 0.7) gives the most interesting mazes

### Arguments

- `grid_shape: Coord`: the shape of the grid
- `lattice_dim: int`: the dimension of the lattice (default: `2`)
- `p: float`: the probability of a cell being accessible (default:
  `0.5`)
- `start_coord: Coord | None`: the starting coordinate for the connected
  component (default: `None` will give a random start)

  cause an error. (defaults to `True`)
- `allowed_start : CoordList | None` a list of allowed start positions.
  If `None`, any position in the connected component is allowed
  (defaults to `None`)
- `allowed_end : CoordList | None` a list of allowed end positions. If
  `None`, any position in the connected component is allowed (defaults
  to `None`)

```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/token_utils.py#L324-L382)

Returns if the rollout strings are equal, allowing for differently
sequenced adjacency lists. <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END> tokens must
be in the rollouts. Intended ONLY for determining if two tokenization
schemes are the same for rollouts generated from the same maze. This
function should NOT be used to determine if two rollouts encode the same
`LatticeMaze` object.

### Warning: CTT False Positives

This function is not robustly correct for some corner cases using
`CoordTokenizers.CTT`. If rollouts are passed for identical tokenizers
processing two slightly different mazes, a false positive is possible.
More specifically, some cases of zero-sum adding and removing of
connections in a maze within square regions along the diagonal will
produce a false positive.

### `def connection_list_to_adj_list`

``` python
(
    conn_list: jaxtyping.Bool[ndarray, 'lattice_dim=2 row col'],
    shuffle_d0: bool = True,
    shuffle_d1: bool = True
) -> jaxtyping.Int8[ndarray, 'conn start_end=2 coord=2']
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/token_utils.py#L385-L438)

converts a `ConnectionList` (special lattice format) to a shuffled
adjacency list

### Parameters:

- `conn_list: ConnectionList` special internal format for graphs which
  are subgraphs of a lattice
- `shuffle_d0: bool` shuffle the adjacency list along the 0th axis
  (order of pairs)
- `shuffle_d1: bool` shuffle the adjacency list along the 1st axis
  (order of coordinates in each pair). If `False`, all pairs have the
  smaller coord first.

### Returns:

- `Int8[np.ndarray, "conn start_end=2 coord=2"]` adjacency list in the
  shape `(n_connections, 2, 2)`

### `def is_connection`

``` python
(
    edges: jaxtyping.Int8[ndarray, 'edges leading_trailing_coord=2 row_col=2'],
    connection_list: jaxtyping.Bool[ndarray, 'lattice_dim=2 row col']
) -> jaxtyping.Bool[ndarray, 'is_connection=edges']
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/token_utils.py#L441-L451)

Returns if each edge in `edges` is a connection (`True`) or wall
(`False`) in `connection_list`.

legacy tokenization modes

> \[!CAUTION\] Legacy mode of tokenization. will still be around in
> future releases, but is no longer recommended for use. Use
> `MazeTokenizerModular` instead.

### Abbreviations:

- `AOTP`: Ajacency list, Origin, Target, Path
- `UT`: Unique Token (for each coordiate)
- `CTT`: Coordinate Tuple Tokens (each coordinate is tokenized as a
  tuple of integers)

### Modes:

- `AOTP_UT_rasterized`: the “classic” mode: assigning tokens to each
  coordinate is done via rasterization example: for a 3x3 maze, token
  order is
  `(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)`

- `AOTP_UT_uniform`: new mode, where a 3x3 tokenization scheme and 5x5
  tokenizations scheme are compatible uses `corner_first_ndindex`
  function to order the tokens

- `AOTP_CTT_indexed`: each coordinate is a tuple of integers

- `AOTP_UT_rasterized = <TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_rasterized: 'AOTP_UT_rasterized'>`

- `AOTP_UT_uniform = <TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_uniform: 'AOTP_UT_uniform'>`

- `AOTP_CTT_indexed = <TokenizationMode.AOTP_CTT_indexed: 'AOTP_CTT_indexed'>`

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L462-L680)

Superclass for tokenizer elements. Subclasses contain modular
functionality for maze tokenization.

### Development

> \[!TIP\] Due to the functionality of `get_all_tokenizers()`,
> `_TokenizerElement` subclasses may only contain fields of type
> `utils.FiniteValued`. Implementing a subclass with an `int` or
> `float`-typed field, for example, is not supported. In the event that
> adding such fields is deemed necessary, `get_all_tokenizers()` must be
> updated.

### `def tokenizer_elements`

``` python
(
    self,
    deep: bool = True
) -> list[maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer._TokenizerElement]
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L531-L587)

Returns a list of all `_TokenizerElement` instances contained in the
subtree. Currently only detects `_TokenizerElement` instances which are
either direct attributes of another instance or which sit inside a
`tuple` without further nesting.

### Parameters

- `deep: bool`: Whether to return elements nested arbitrarily deeply or
  just a single layer.

### `def tokenizer_element_tree`

``` python
(self, depth: int = 0, abstract: bool = False) -> str
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L589-L609)

Returns a string representation of the tree of tokenizer elements
contained in `self`.

### Parameters

- `depth: int`: Current depth in the tree. Used internally for
  recursion, no need to specify.
- `abstract: bool`: Whether to print the name of the abstract base class
  or the concrete class for each `_TokenizerElement` instance.

### `def tokenizer_element_dict`

``` python
(self) -> dict
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L611-L636)

Returns a dictionary representation of the tree of tokenizer elements
contained in `self`.

### `def attribute_key`

``` python
(cls) -> str
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L638-L642)

Returns the binding used in `MazeTokenizerModular` for that type of
`_TokenizerElement`.

### `def to_tokens`

``` python
(self, *args, **kwargs) -> list[str]
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L644-L649)

Converts a maze element into a list of tokens. Not all
`_TokenizerElement` subclasses produce tokens, so this is not an
abstract method. Those subclasses which do produce tokens should
override this method.

### `def is_valid`

``` python
(self) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L651-L680)

Returns if `self` contains data members capable of producing an overall
valid `MazeTokenizerModular`. Some `_TokenizerElement` instances may be
created which are not useful despite obeying data member type hints.
`is_valid` allows for more precise detection of invalid
`_TokenizerElement`s beyond type hinting alone. If type hints are
sufficient to constrain the possible instances of some subclass, then
this method may simply `return True` for that subclass.

### Types of Invalidity

In nontrivial implementations of this method, each conditional clause
should contain a comment classifying the reason for invalidity and one
of the types below. Invalidity types, in ascending order of
invalidity: - Uninteresting: These tokenizers might be used to train
functional models, but the schemes are not interesting to study. E.g.,
`_TokenizerElement`s which are strictly worse than some alternative. -
Duplicate: These tokenizers have identical tokenization behavior as some
other valid tokenizers. - Untrainable: Training functional models using
these tokenizers would be (nearly) impossible. - Erroneous: These
tokenizers might raise exceptions during use.

### Development

`is_invalid` is implemented to always return `True` in some abstract
classes where all currently possible subclass instances are valid. When
adding new subclasses or data members, the developer should check if any
such blanket statement of validity still holds and update it as
neccesary.

#### Nesting

In general, when implementing this method, there is no need to
recursively call `is_valid` on nested `_TokenizerElement`s contained in
the class. In other words, failures of `is_valid` need not bubble up to
the top of the nested `_TokenizerElement` tree.

calls `is_valid` on each of its `_TokenizerElement`s individually, so
failure at any level will be detected.

#### Types of Invalidity

If it’s judged to be useful, the types of invalidity could be
implemented with an Enum or similar rather than only living in comments.
This could be used to create more or less stringent filters on the valid
`_TokenizerElement` instances.

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L1903-L2195)

Tokenizer for mazes

### Parameters

- `prompt_sequencer`: Tokenizer element which assembles token regions
  (adjacency list, origin, target, path) into a complete prompt.

### Development

- To ensure backwards compatibility, the default constructor must always
  return a tokenizer equivalent to the legacy
  `TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_Uniform`.
- Furthermore, the mapping reflected in `from_legacy` must also be
  maintained.
- Updates to `MazeTokenizerModular` or the `_TokenizerElement` hierarchy
  must maintain that behavior.

### `MazeTokenizerModular`

``` python
(
    *,
    prompt_sequencer: maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer.PromptSequencers._PromptSequencer = PromptSequencers.AOTP(coord_tokenizer=CoordTokenizers.UT(), adj_list_tokenizer=AdjListTokenizers.AdjListCoord(pre=False, post=True, shuffle_d0=True, edge_grouping=EdgeGroupings.Ungrouped(connection_token_ordinal=1), edge_subset=EdgeSubsets.ConnectionEdges(walls=False), edge_permuter=EdgePermuters.RandomCoords()), target_tokenizer=TargetTokenizers.Unlabeled(post=False), path_tokenizer=PathTokenizers.StepSequence(step_size=StepSizes.Singles(), step_tokenizers=(StepTokenizers.Coord(),), pre=False, intra=False, post=False))
)
```

- `prompt_sequencer: maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer.PromptSequencers._PromptSequencer = PromptSequencers.AOTP(coord_tokenizer=CoordTokenizers.UT(), adj_list_tokenizer=AdjListTokenizers.AdjListCoord(pre=False, post=True, shuffle_d0=True, edge_grouping=EdgeGroupings.Ungrouped(connection_token_ordinal=1), edge_subset=EdgeSubsets.ConnectionEdges(walls=False), edge_permuter=EdgePermuters.RandomCoords()), target_tokenizer=TargetTokenizers.Unlabeled(post=False), path_tokenizer=PathTokenizers.StepSequence(step_size=StepSizes.Singles(), step_tokenizers=(StepTokenizers.Coord(),), pre=False, intra=False, post=False))`

- `abstract: bool`: Whether to print the name of the abstract base class
  or the concrete class for each `_TokenizerElement` instance.

- `tokenizer_element_tree_concrete`

[View Source on

```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L1988-L1995)

Single-level dictionary of the internal `TokenizerElement`s.

### `def has_element`

``` python
(
    self,
    *elements: Sequence[type[maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer._TokenizerElement] | maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer._TokenizerElement]
) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L2014-L2030)

Returns True if the `MazeTokenizerModular` instance contains ALL of the
items specified in `elements`.

Querying with a partial subset of `_TokenizerElement` fields is not
currently supported. To do such a query, assemble multiple calls to
`has_elements`.

### Parameters

- `elements`: Singleton or iterable of `_TokenizerElement` instances or
  classes. If an instance is provided, then comparison is done via
  instance equality. If a class is provided, then comparison isdone via
  `isinstance`. I.e., any instance of that class is accepted.

### `def is_valid`

``` python
(self)
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L2032-L2037)

Returns `True` if `self` is a valid tokenizer. Evaluates the validity of
all of `self.tokenizer_elements` according to each one’s method.

### `def is_legacy_equivalent`

``` python
(self) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L2039-L2046)

Returns if `self` has identical stringification behavior as any legacy
`MazeTokenizer`.

### `def is_tested_tokenizer`

```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L2048-L2075)

Returns if the tokenizer is returned by
`all_tokenizers.get_all_tokenizers`, the set of tested and reliable
tokenizers.

Since evaluating `all_tokenizers.get_all_tokenizers` is expensive,
instead checks for membership of `self`’s hash in
`get_all_tokenizer_hashes()`.

if `do_assert` is `True`, raises an `AssertionError` if the tokenizer is
not tested.

Converts a maze element into a list of tokens. Not all
`_TokenizerElement` subclasses produce tokens, so this is not an
abstract method. Those subclasses which do produce tokens should
override this method.

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L849-L889)

All edges with the same leading coord are grouped together.

### Parameters

- `intra`: Whether all edge groupings include a delimiter token between
  individual edge representations. Note that each edge representation
  will already always include a connector token (`VOCAB.CONNECTOR`, or
  possibly \`)
- `shuffle_group`: Whether the sequence of edges within the group should
  be shuffled or appear in a fixed order. If false, the fixed order is
  lexicographical by (row, col). In effect, lexicographical sorting
  sorts edges by their cardinal direction in the sequence NORTH, WEST,
  EAST, SOUTH, where the directions indicate the position of the
  trailing coord relative to the leading coord.
- `connection_token_ordinal`: At which index in token sequence
  representing a single edge the connector (or wall) token appears. Edge
  tokenizations contain 2 parts: a connector (or wall) token and a coord
  or cardinal tokenization.

### `EdgeGroupings.ByLeadingCoord`

    shuffle_group: bool = True,
    connection_token_ordinal: Literal[0, 1] = 0

```

- `intra: bool = True`

- `shuffle_group: bool = True`

### `def is_valid`

``` python
(self_)
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L850-L889)

Returns if `self` contains data members capable of producing an overall
valid `MazeTokenizerModular`. Some `_TokenizerElement` instances may be
created which are not useful despite obeying data member type hints.
`is_valid` allows for more precise detection of invalid
`_TokenizerElement`s beyond type hinting alone. If type hints are
sufficient to constrain the possible instances of some subclass, then
this method may simply `return True` for that subclass.

### Types of Invalidity

In nontrivial implementations of this method, each conditional clause
should contain a comment classifying the reason for invalidity and one
of the types below. Invalidity types, in ascending order of
invalidity: - Uninteresting: These tokenizers might be used to train
functional models, but the schemes are not interesting to study. E.g.,
`_TokenizerElement`s which are strictly worse than some alternative. -
Duplicate: These tokenizers have identical tokenization behavior as some
other valid tokenizers. - Untrainable: Training functional models using
these tokenizers would be (nearly) impossible. - Erroneous: These
tokenizers might raise exceptions during use.

### Development

`is_invalid` is implemented to always return `True` in some abstract
classes where all currently possible subclass instances are valid. When
adding new subclasses or data members, the developer should check if any
such blanket statement of validity still holds and update it as
neccesary.

#### Nesting

In general, when implementing this method, there is no need to
recursively call `is_valid` on nested `_TokenizerElement`s contained in
the class. In other words, failures of `is_valid` need not bubble up to
the top of the nested `_TokenizerElement` tree.
`<a href="#MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid">MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid</a>`
calls `is_valid` on each of its `_TokenizerElement`s individually, so
failure at any level will be detected.

#### Types of Invalidity

If it’s judged to be useful, the types of invalidity could be
implemented with an Enum or similar rather than only living in comments.
This could be used to create more or less stringent filters on the valid
`_TokenizerElement` instances.

``` python
(self) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L1318-L1320)

Returns if `self` contains data members capable of producing an overall
valid `MazeTokenizerModular`. Some `_TokenizerElement` instances may be
created which are not useful despite obeying data member type hints.
`is_valid` allows for more precise detection of invalid
`_TokenizerElement`s beyond type hinting alone. If type hints are
sufficient to constrain the possible instances of some subclass, then
this method may simply `return True` for that subclass.

### Types of Invalidity

In nontrivial implementations of this method, each conditional clause
should contain a comment classifying the reason for invalidity and one
of the types below. Invalidity types, in ascending order of
invalidity: - Uninteresting: These tokenizers might be used to train
functional models, but the schemes are not interesting to study. E.g.,
`_TokenizerElement`s which are strictly worse than some alternative. -
Duplicate: These tokenizers have identical tokenization behavior as some
other valid tokenizers. - Untrainable: Training functional models using
these tokenizers would be (nearly) impossible. - Erroneous: These
tokenizers might raise exceptions during use.

### Development

`is_invalid` is implemented to always return `True` in some abstract
classes where all currently possible subclass instances are valid. When
adding new subclasses or data members, the developer should check if any
such blanket statement of validity still holds and update it as
neccesary.

#### Nesting

In general, when implementing this method, there is no need to
recursively call `is_valid` on nested `_TokenizerElement`s contained in
the class. In other words, failures of `is_valid` need not bubble up to
the top of the nested `_TokenizerElement` tree.
`<a href="#MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid">MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid</a>`
calls `is_valid` on each of its `_TokenizerElement`s individually, so
failure at any level will be detected.

#### Types of Invalidity

If it’s judged to be useful, the types of invalidity could be
implemented with an Enum or similar rather than only living in comments.
This could be used to create more or less stringent filters on the valid
`_TokenizerElement` instances.

### `def is_valid`

``` python
(self) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/__init__.py#L1653-L1664)

Returns if `self` contains data members capable of producing an overall
valid `MazeTokenizerModular`. Some `_TokenizerElement` instances may be
created which are not useful despite obeying data member type hints.
`is_valid` allows for more precise detection of invalid
`_TokenizerElement`s beyond type hinting alone. If type hints are
sufficient to constrain the possible instances of some subclass, then
this method may simply `return True` for that subclass.

### Types of Invalidity

In nontrivial implementations of this method, each conditional clause
should contain a comment classifying the reason for invalidity and one
of the types below. Invalidity types, in ascending order of
invalidity: - Uninteresting: These tokenizers might be used to train
functional models, but the schemes are not interesting to study. E.g.,
`_TokenizerElement`s which are strictly worse than some alternative. -
Duplicate: These tokenizers have identical tokenization behavior as some
other valid tokenizers. - Untrainable: Training functional models using
these tokenizers would be (nearly) impossible. - Erroneous: These
tokenizers might raise exceptions during use.

### Development

`is_invalid` is implemented to always return `True` in some abstract
classes where all currently possible subclass instances are valid. When
adding new subclasses or data members, the developer should check if any
such blanket statement of validity still holds and update it as
neccesary.

#### Nesting

In general, when implementing this method, there is no need to
recursively call `is_valid` on nested `_TokenizerElement`s contained in
the class. In other words, failures of `is_valid` need not bubble up to
the top of the nested `_TokenizerElement` tree.
`<a href="#MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid">MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid</a>`
calls `is_valid` on each of its `_TokenizerElement`s individually, so
failure at any level will be detected.

#### Types of Invalidity

If it’s judged to be useful, the types of invalidity could be
implemented with an Enum or similar rather than only living in comments.
This could be used to create more or less stringent filters on the valid
`_TokenizerElement` instances.

LEGACY Tokenizer for mazes

> \[!CAUTION\] `MazeTokenizerModular` is the new standard for
> tokenization. This class is no longer recommended for use, but will
> remain for compatibility with existing code.

### Parameters:

- `tokenization_mode: TokenizationMode` mode of tokenization. required.
- `max_grid_size: int | None` maximum grid size. required for actually
  turning text tokens to numerical tokens, but not for moving between
  coordinates/mazes and text

### Properties

- `name: str` auto-generated name of the tokenizer from mode and size

#### Conditional Properties

- `node_strings_map: Mapping[CoordTup, str]` map from node to string.
  This returns a `muutils.kappa.Kappa` object which you can use like a
  dictionary. returns `None` if not a `UT` mode

these all return `None` if `max_grid_size` is `None`. Prepend `_` to the
name to get a guaranteed type, and cause an exception if `max_grid_size`
is `None`

- `token_arr: list[str]` list of tokens, in order of their indices in
  the vocabulary
- `tokenizer_map: Mapping[str, int]` map from token to index
- `vocab_size: int` size of the vocabulary
- `padding_token_index: int` index of the padding token

### Methods

- `coords_to_strings(coords: list[CoordTup]) -> list[str]` convert a
  list of coordinates to a list of tokens. Optionally except, skip, or
  ignore non-coordinates
- `strings_to_coords(strings: list[str]) -> list[CoordTup]` convert a
  list of tokens to a list of coordinates. Optionally except, skip, or
  ignore non-coordinates

## Contents

Contains `get_all_tokenizers()` and supporting limited-use functions.

# `get_all_tokenizers()`

returns a comprehensive collection of all valid `MazeTokenizerModular`
objects. This is an overwhelming majority subset of the set of all
possible `MazeTokenizerModular` objects. Other tokenizers not contained
in `get_all_tokenizers()` may be possible to construct, but they are
untested and not guaranteed to work. This collection is in a separate
module since it is expensive to compute and will grow more expensive as
features are added to `MazeTokenizerModular`.

## Use Cases

In general, uses for this module are limited to development of the
library and specific research studying many tokenization behaviors. -
Unit testing: - Tokenizers to use in unit tests are sampled from
`get_all_tokenizers()` - Large-scale tokenizer research: - Specific
research training models on many tokenization behaviors can use
`get_all_tokenizers()` as the maximally inclusive collection -
`get_all_tokenizers()` may be subsequently filtered using
`MazeTokenizerModular.has_element` For other uses, it’s likely that the
computational expense can be avoided by using -
`maze_tokenizer.get_all_tokenizer_hashes()` for membership checks -
`utils.all_instances` for generating smaller subsets of
`MazeTokenizerModular` or `_TokenizerElement` objects

# `EVERY_TEST_TOKENIZERS`

A collection of the tokenizers which should always be included in unit
tests when test fuzzing is used. This collection should be expanded as
specific tokenizers become canonical or popular.

legacy tokenization modes

> \[!CAUTION\] Legacy mode of tokenization. will still be around in
> future releases, but is no longer recommended for use. Use
> `MazeTokenizerModular` instead.

### Abbreviations:

- `AOTP`: Ajacency list, Origin, Target, Path
- `UT`: Unique Token (for each coordiate)
- `CTT`: Coordinate Tuple Tokens (each coordinate is tokenized as a
  tuple of integers)

### Modes:

- `AOTP_UT_rasterized`: the “classic” mode: assigning tokens to each
  coordinate is done via rasterization example: for a 3x3 maze, token
  order is
  `(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)`

- `AOTP_UT_uniform`: new mode, where a 3x3 tokenization scheme and 5x5
  tokenizations scheme are compatible uses `corner_first_ndindex`
  function to order the tokens

- `AOTP_CTT_indexed`: each coordinate is a tuple of integers

- `AOTP_UT_rasterized = <TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_rasterized: 'AOTP_UT_rasterized'>`

- `AOTP_UT_uniform = <TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_uniform: 'AOTP_UT_uniform'>`

LEGACY Tokenizer for mazes

> \[!CAUTION\] `MazeTokenizerModular` is the new standard for
> tokenization. This class is no longer recommended for use, but will
> remain for compatibility with existing code.

### Parameters:

- `tokenization_mode: TokenizationMode` mode of tokenization. required.
- `max_grid_size: int | None` maximum grid size. required for actually
  turning text tokens to numerical tokens, but not for moving between
  coordinates/mazes and text

### Properties

- `name: str` auto-generated name of the tokenizer from mode and size

#### Conditional Properties

- `node_strings_map: Mapping[CoordTup, str]` map from node to string.
  This returns a `muutils.kappa.Kappa` object which you can use like a
  dictionary. returns `None` if not a `UT` mode

these all return `None` if `max_grid_size` is `None`. Prepend `_` to the
name to get a guaranteed type, and cause an exception if `max_grid_size`
is `None`

- `token_arr: list[str]` list of tokens, in order of their indices in
  the vocabulary
- `tokenizer_map: Mapping[str, int]` map from token to index
- `vocab_size: int` size of the vocabulary
- `padding_token_index: int` index of the padding token

### Methods

- `coords_to_strings(coords: list[CoordTup]) -> list[str]` convert a
  list of coordinates to a list of tokens. Optionally except, skip, or
  ignore non-coordinates
- `strings_to_coords(strings: list[str]) -> list[CoordTup]` convert a
  list of tokens to a list of coordinates. Optionally except, skip, or
  ignore non-coordinates

mark a \_TokenizerElement as unsupported.

Classes marked with this decorator won’t show up in
`get_all_tokenizers()` and thus wont be tested. The classes marked in
release 1.0.0 did work reliably before being marked, but they can’t be
instantiated since the decorator adds an abstract method. The decorator
exists to prune the space of tokenizers returned by `all_instances` both
for testing and usage. Previously, the space was too large, resulting in
impractical runtimes. These decorators could be removed in future
releases to expand the space of possible tokenizers.

No grouping occurs, each edge is tokenized individually.

### Parameters

- `connection_token_ordinal`: At which index in the edge tokenization
  the connector (or wall) token appears. Edge tokenizations contain 3
  parts: a leading coord, a connector (or wall) token, and either a
  second coord or cardinal direction tokenization.

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L849-L889)

All edges with the same leading coord are grouped together.

### Parameters

- `intra`: Whether all edge groupings include a delimiter token between
  individual edge representations. Note that each edge representation
  will already always include a connector token (`VOCAB.CONNECTOR`, or
  possibly \`)
- `shuffle_group`: Whether the sequence of edges within the group should
  be shuffled or appear in a fixed order. If false, the fixed order is
  lexicographical by (row, col). In effect, lexicographical sorting
  sorts edges by their cardinal direction in the sequence NORTH, WEST,
  EAST, SOUTH, where the directions indicate the position of the
  trailing coord relative to the leading coord.
- `connection_token_ordinal`: At which index in token sequence
  representing a single edge the connector (or wall) token appears. Edge
  tokenizations contain 2 parts: a connector (or wall) token and a coord
  or cardinal tokenization.

### `EdgeGroupings.ByLeadingCoord`

``` python
(
    *,
    _type_: Literal["<class 'maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer.EdgeGroupings.ByLeadingCoord'>"] = "<class 'maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer.EdgeGroupings.ByLeadingCoord'>",

```

- `intra: bool = True`

### `def is_valid`

``` python
(self_)
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L850-L889)

Returns if `self` contains data members capable of producing an overall
valid `MazeTokenizerModular`. Some `_TokenizerElement` instances may be
created which are not useful despite obeying data member type hints.
`is_valid` allows for more precise detection of invalid
`_TokenizerElement`s beyond type hinting alone. If type hints are
sufficient to constrain the possible instances of some subclass, then
this method may simply `return True` for that subclass.

### Types of Invalidity

In nontrivial implementations of this method, each conditional clause
should contain a comment classifying the reason for invalidity and one
of the types below. Invalidity types, in ascending order of
invalidity: - Uninteresting: These tokenizers might be used to train
functional models, but the schemes are not interesting to study. E.g.,
`_TokenizerElement`s which are strictly worse than some alternative. -
Duplicate: These tokenizers have identical tokenization behavior as some
other valid tokenizers. - Untrainable: Training functional models using
these tokenizers would be (nearly) impossible. - Erroneous: These
tokenizers might raise exceptions during use.

### Development

`is_invalid` is implemented to always return `True` in some abstract
classes where all currently possible subclass instances are valid. When
adding new subclasses or data members, the developer should check if any
such blanket statement of validity still holds and update it as
neccesary.

#### Nesting

In general, when implementing this method, there is no need to
recursively call `is_valid` on nested `_TokenizerElement`s contained in
the class. In other words, failures of `is_valid` need not bubble up to
the top of the nested `_TokenizerElement` tree.
`<a href="#MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid">MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid</a>`
calls `is_valid` on each of its `_TokenizerElement`s individually, so
failure at any level will be detected.

#### Types of Invalidity

If it’s judged to be useful, the types of invalidity could be
implemented with an Enum or similar rather than only living in comments.
This could be used to create more or less stringent filters on the valid
`_TokenizerElement` instances.

### `def is_valid`

(self) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L1318-L1320)

Returns if `self` contains data members capable of producing an overall
valid `MazeTokenizerModular`. Some `_TokenizerElement` instances may be
created which are not useful despite obeying data member type hints.
`is_valid` allows for more precise detection of invalid
`_TokenizerElement`s beyond type hinting alone. If type hints are
sufficient to constrain the possible instances of some subclass, then
this method may simply `return True` for that subclass.

### Types of Invalidity

In nontrivial implementations of this method, each conditional clause
should contain a comment classifying the reason for invalidity and one
of the types below. Invalidity types, in ascending order of
invalidity: - Uninteresting: These tokenizers might be used to train
functional models, but the schemes are not interesting to study. E.g.,
`_TokenizerElement`s which are strictly worse than some alternative. -
Duplicate: These tokenizers have identical tokenization behavior as some
other valid tokenizers. - Untrainable: Training functional models using
these tokenizers would be (nearly) impossible. - Erroneous: These
tokenizers might raise exceptions during use.

### Development

`is_invalid` is implemented to always return `True` in some abstract
classes where all currently possible subclass instances are valid. When
adding new subclasses or data members, the developer should check if any
such blanket statement of validity still holds and update it as
neccesary.

#### Nesting

In general, when implementing this method, there is no need to
recursively call `is_valid` on nested `_TokenizerElement`s contained in
the class. In other words, failures of `is_valid` need not bubble up to
the top of the nested `_TokenizerElement` tree.
`<a href="#MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid">MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid</a>`
calls `is_valid` on each of its `_TokenizerElement`s individually, so
failure at any level will be detected.

#### Types of Invalidity

If it’s judged to be useful, the types of invalidity could be
implemented with an Enum or similar rather than only living in comments.
This could be used to create more or less stringent filters on the valid
`_TokenizerElement` instances.

### `def is_valid`

``` python
(self) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L1653-L1664)

Returns if `self` contains data members capable of producing an overall
valid `MazeTokenizerModular`. Some `_TokenizerElement` instances may be
created which are not useful despite obeying data member type hints.
`is_valid` allows for more precise detection of invalid
`_TokenizerElement`s beyond type hinting alone. If type hints are
sufficient to constrain the possible instances of some subclass, then
this method may simply `return True` for that subclass.

### Types of Invalidity

In nontrivial implementations of this method, each conditional clause
should contain a comment classifying the reason for invalidity and one
of the types below. Invalidity types, in ascending order of
invalidity: - Uninteresting: These tokenizers might be used to train
functional models, but the schemes are not interesting to study. E.g.,
`_TokenizerElement`s which are strictly worse than some alternative. -
Duplicate: These tokenizers have identical tokenization behavior as some
other valid tokenizers. - Untrainable: Training functional models using
these tokenizers would be (nearly) impossible. - Erroneous: These
tokenizers might raise exceptions during use.

### Development

`is_invalid` is implemented to always return `True` in some abstract
classes where all currently possible subclass instances are valid. When
adding new subclasses or data members, the developer should check if any
such blanket statement of validity still holds and update it as
neccesary.

#### Nesting

In general, when implementing this method, there is no need to
recursively call `is_valid` on nested `_TokenizerElement`s contained in
the class. In other words, failures of `is_valid` need not bubble up to
the top of the nested `_TokenizerElement` tree.
`<a href="#MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid">MazeTokenizerModular.is_valid</a>`
calls `is_valid` on each of its `_TokenizerElement`s individually, so
failure at any level will be detected.

#### Types of Invalidity

If it’s judged to be useful, the types of invalidity could be
implemented with an Enum or similar rather than only living in comments.
This could be used to create more or less stringent filters on the valid
`_TokenizerElement` instances.

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L1866-L1900)

Sequences a prompt as \[adjacency list, origin, path\]. Still includes
“<TARGET_START>” and “<TARGET_END>” tokens, but no representation of the
target itself.

### Parameters

- `path_tokenizer`: Tokenizer element which tokenizes the solution path
  of a `SolvedMaze`. Uses `coord_tokenizer` to tokenize coords if that
  is part of the design of that `PathTokenizer`.

### `PromptSequencers.AOP`

``` python
(
    *,
    coord_tokenizer: maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer.CoordTokenizers._CoordTokenizer = CoordTokenizers.UT(),
    adj_list_tokenizer: maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer.AdjListTokenizers._AdjListTokenizer = AdjListTokenizers.AdjListCoord(pre=False, post=True, shuffle_d0=True, edge_grouping=EdgeGroupings.Ungrouped(connection_token_ordinal=1), edge_subset=EdgeSubsets.ConnectionEdges(walls=False), edge_permuter=EdgePermuters.RandomCoords()),

[View Source on

Tokenizer for mazes

### Parameters

- `prompt_sequencer`: Tokenizer element which assembles token regions
  (adjacency list, origin, target, path) into a complete prompt.

### Development

- To ensure backwards compatibility, the default constructor must always
  return a tokenizer equivalent to the legacy
  `TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_Uniform`.
- Furthermore, the mapping reflected in `from_legacy` must also be
  maintained.
- Updates to `MazeTokenizerModular` or the `_TokenizerElement` hierarchy
  must maintain that behavior.

### `MazeTokenizerModular`

``` python
(
    *,
    prompt_sequencer: maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer.PromptSequencers._PromptSequencer = PromptSequencers.AOTP(coord_tokenizer=CoordTokenizers.UT(), adj_list_tokenizer=AdjListTokenizers.AdjListCoord(pre=False, post=True, shuffle_d0=True, edge_grouping=EdgeGroupings.Ungrouped(connection_token_ordinal=1), edge_subset=EdgeSubsets.ConnectionEdges(walls=False), edge_permuter=EdgePermuters.RandomCoords()), target_tokenizer=TargetTokenizers.Unlabeled(post=False), path_tokenizer=PathTokenizers.StepSequence(step_size=StepSizes.Singles(), step_tokenizers=(StepTokenizers.Coord(),), pre=False, intra=False, post=False))
)
```

Single-level dictionary of the internal `TokenizerElement`s.

### `def has_element`

``` python
(
    self,
    *elements: Sequence[type[maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer._TokenizerElement] | maze_dataset.tokenization.maze_tokenizer._TokenizerElement]
) -> bool
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L2014-L2030)

Returns True if the `MazeTokenizerModular` instance contains ALL of the
items specified in `elements`.

Querying with a partial subset of `_TokenizerElement` fields is not
currently supported. To do such a query, assemble multiple calls to
`has_elements`.

### Parameters

- `elements`: Singleton or iterable of `_TokenizerElement` instances or
  classes. If an instance is provided, then comparison is done via
  instance equality. If a class is provided, then comparison isdone via
  `isinstance`. I.e., any instance of that class is accepted.

### `def is_valid`

``` python
(self)
```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L2032-L2037)

### `def is_legacy_equivalent`

``` python
(self) -> bool

```

[View Source on
GitHub](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset/blob/main/maze_dataset/tokenization/maze_tokenizer.py#L2048-L2075)

Returns if the tokenizer is returned by
`all_tokenizers.get_all_tokenizers`, the set of tested and reliable
tokenizers.

Since evaluating `all_tokenizers.get_all_tokenizers` is expensive,
instead checks for membership of `self`’s hash in
`get_all_tokenizer_hashes()`.

if `do_assert` is `True`, raises an `AssertionError` if the tokenizer is
not tested.

coordinates within each coordinate pair.

- `FiniteValued = ~FiniteValued`

### `FiniteValued`

The details of this type are not possible to fully define via the Python
3.10 typing library. This custom generic type is a generic domain of
many types which have a finite, discrete, and well-defined range space.
`FiniteValued` defines the domain of supported types for the
`all_instances` function, since that function relies heavily on static
typing. These types may be nested in an arbitrarily deep tree via
Container Types and Superclass Types (see below). The leaves of the tree
must always be Primitive Types.

### `FiniteValued` Subtypes

\*: Indicates that this subtype is not yet supported by `all_instances`

#### Non-`FiniteValued` (Unbounded) Types

These are NOT valid subtypes, and are listed for illustrative purposes
only. This list is not comprehensive. While the finite and discrete
nature of digital computers means that the cardinality of these types is
technically finite, they are considered unbounded types in this
context. - No Container subtype may contain any of these unbounded
subtypes. - `int` - `float` - `str` - `list` - `set`: Set types without
a `FiniteValued` argument are unbounded - `tuple`: Tuple types without a
fixed length are unbounded

#### Primitive Types

Primitive types are non-nested types which resolve directly to a
concrete range of values - `bool`: has 2 possible values -
\*`enum.Enum`: The range of a concrete `Enum` subclass is its set of
enum members - `typing.Literal`: Every type constructed using `Literal`
has a finite set of possible literal values in its definition. This is
the preferred way to include limited ranges of non-`FiniteValued` types
such as `int` or `str` in a `FiniteValued` hierarchy.

#### Container Types

Container types are types which contain zero or more fields of
`FiniteValued` type. The range of a container type is the cartesian
product of their field types, except for `set[FiniteValued]`. -
`tuple[FiniteValued]`: Tuples of fixed length whose elements are each
`FiniteValued`. - `IsDataclass`: Concrete dataclasses whose fields are
`FiniteValued`. - *Standard concrete class: Regular classes could be
supported just like dataclasses if all their data members are
`FiniteValued`-typed. - *`set[FiniteValued]`: Sets of fixed length of a
`FiniteValued` type.

#### Superclass Types

Superclass types don’t directly contain data members like container
types. Their range is the union of the ranges of their subtypes. -
Abstract dataclasses: Abstract dataclasses whose subclasses are all
`FiniteValued` superclass or container types - *`IsDataclass`: Concrete
dataclasses which also have their own subclasses. - *Standard abstract
classes: Abstract dataclasses whose subclasses are all `FiniteValued`
superclass or container types - `UnionType`: Any union of `FiniteValued`
types, e.g., bool \| Literal\[2, 3\]

Returns all possible values of an instance of `type_` if finite
instances exist. Uses type hinting to construct the possible values. All
nested elements of `type_` must themselves be typed. Do not use with
types whose members contain circular references. Function is susceptible
to infinite recursion if `type_` is a dataclass whose member tree
includes another instance of `type_`.

### Parameters

- `type_: FiniteValued` A finite-valued type. See docstring on
  `FiniteValued` for full details.
- `validation_funcs: dict[FiniteValued, Callable[[FiniteValued], bool]] | None`
  A mapping of types to auxiliary functions to validate instances of
  that type. This optional argument can provide an additional, more
  precise layer of validation for the instances generated beyond what
  type hinting alone can provide. See `validation_funcs` Details section
  below. (default: `None`)

#### Supported `type_` Values

See docstring on `FiniteValued` for full details. `type_` may be: -
`FiniteValued` - A finite-valued, fixed-length Generic tuple type. E.g.,
`tuple[bool]`, `tuple[bool, MyEnum]` are OK. `tuple[bool, ...]` is NOT
supported, since the length of the tuple is not fixed. - Nested versions
of any of the types in this list - A `UnionType` of any of the types in
this list

#### `validation_funcs` Details

- `validation_funcs` is applied after all instances have been generated
  according to type hints.
- If `type_` is in `validation_funcs`, then the list of instances is
  filtered by `validation_funcs[type_](instance)`.
- `validation_funcs` is passed down for all recursive calls of
  `all_instances`.
- This allows for improved performance through maximal pruning of the
  exponential tree.
- `validation_funcs` supports subclass checking.
- If `type_` is not found in `validation_funcs`, then the search is
  performed iteratively in mro order.
- If a superclass of `type_` is found while searching in mro order, that
  validation function is applied and the list is returned.
- If no superclass of `type_` is found, then no filter is applied.
